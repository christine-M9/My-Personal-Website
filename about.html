    <li>I am a Kenyan citizen who embraces technology growth. Always ready to work in the tech world as a software developer by coming up with solutions in the programming world. </li>
     <li>I have just over a year of experience as a junior civil engineer specialised in Materials testing and quality control with Hyoung & co. East Africa. In my short time there, I've already contributed to over a hundred results and assisted with managing the quality control department.
Prior to this role, I completed my industrial attachments with KeNHA[Kenya National Highways Authority in 2019], and NWHSA[National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority in 2018] where I honed development skills. Ideally, I have gotten into software engineering, an area where I know i'm contributing much to Technology majorly as a problem solver.</li>
